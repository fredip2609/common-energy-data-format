# Units 

* All same units per resource / table?
* Unit for each field? 
* Optional field:
  - unit_description (proposed values: electric, higher heating value, etc.)
  - Net / Brutto 

# Aggregation

For each table logic: 
 - rule how to aggregate
 
# Period, snapshot information 
  - Reference date
  - Timeseries (start, end, resolution)   
  - How to deal with non-equidistant timeseries
  - Temporal reference (instantinous vs. average values)

# Spatial 
   - extend, resolution
